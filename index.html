  <h1>Welcome to My DevSecOps Portfolio</h1>
  <p>Hi, I'm a DevSecOps enthusiast passionate about integrating security at every phase of software delivery. I believe security shouldn't be an afterthought; it should be well integrated into the development lifecycle.</p>

  <h2>What I Do</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Automate CI/CD pipelines with security checks</li>
    <li>Use tools like Git, Docker, Kubernetes, and Jenkins</li>
    <li>Run static and dynamic code analysis</li>
    <li>Promote collaboration between Dev, Sec, and Ops teams</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why DevSecOps?</h2>
  <p>Because waiting until production to secure your application is too late. With DevSecOps, security travels with the code from commit to deploy; fast and safe.</p>

  <p>Follow along as I document my journey, projects, and learning notes!</p>
